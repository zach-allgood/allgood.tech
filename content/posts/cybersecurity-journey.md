## Introduction

As my first blog post, and my retelling of my journey, I find it fitting to introduce myself a bit. My name is Zach Allgood and I've been a software engineer for roughly 7 years, focusing mainly on E-Commerce sites running Adobe Commerce (formerly known as Magento 2). As of September 5th, 2023, I am now officially a cybersecurity engineer. I know many are in my shoes, wanting to break into the cybersecurity field from many different backgrounds, and this post will explain what I did to transition from a software background into the realm of cybersecurity, where IT and networking experience is valued over everything. If you take a look at most job postings, they require 3+ years of experience in IT, networking, or help desk, most of them don't mention software engineering at all aside from the Computer Science Bachelor's requirement, so how do you transition into the field with software experience? What if you don't even have any experience in anything technical? I'll breakdown exactly what I did, and what you can do, to help get into the field and start hacking (or protecting against it).

## Education

The first thing you'll see when you browse cybersecurity job postings is the education requirements. "Bachelor's degree in computer science or related field or 2+ years experience" is a common phrase I saw countless times applying to jobs. You'll also see a large portion of job postings in the space requiring some sort of certifications, but there are far too many to list here.

### Bachelor's Degree

If you don't have a degree, don't worry, I didn't either. There's an online university I attended for my degree that is fantastic in my personal opinion. This university is [Western Governors University](https://www.wgu.edu/online-it-degrees/cybersecurity-information-assurance-bachelors-program.html){:target="_blank"}. It's entirely online and includes a large number of certification exams, most of which are required to even graduate. These certifications will be covered later, but for now just know that they are required for you to pass certain classes, which also gives you a leg-up against people that just have their Bachelor's degree. WGU is also a competency-based, self-paced school, meaning that you only have to write papers or take the exams based on the class, nothing else is required. This allows you to advance faster than your average university without suffering from a lack of knowledge. Think of it this way, when I joined I did my web dev class first, because I have 7 years of experience and I knew I could pass it without studying. The first day I started WGU, I took my practice exam, passed, took my final exam, and passed again, closing out an entire class in less than 2 hours. This is the power of competency-based, self-paced schooling. As you go through your term, you may find that you complete all the classes in your term fairly quickly, but you don't have to wait until your term is over to continue passing classes! You can move your classes from your next term into your current term, given that you've already completed the classes in your current term. This allows you to get an entire degree much faster than your average student - I completed mine in just 5 months. Obviously this timeframe depends on your ability to learn new information and how much time you're able to dedicate to it day-to-day, but keep in mind I was working a full 40 hour work week during the time I was in school as well.

**TL;DR:** Check out [WGU](https://www.wgu.edu/online-it-degrees/cybersecurity-information-assurance-bachelors-program.html){:target="_blank"} if you want a Bachelor's in Cybersecurity - it's well worth it and you get a ton of certifications that will give you a leg-up against the competition.

### Certifications

Now we get to possibly one of the most important sections of your resume: the certifications. If you attended WGU like I did, you'll already have enough certifications to land your first role (although there are a few additions you can make to increase your chances), however if you already have your degree, don't want to invest the time/money into the degree, or don't have WGU available in your country, you can still build a great certification portfolio. I've broken down my recommended certifications into 2 categories: Core Certifications and Specialized Certifications. Core Certifications are certifications you should get no matter what niche you plan on going into. These are typically what you'll see on most cybersecurity job postings as requirements or preferred qualifications. Specialized Certifications are here to improve your chances on landing a more specific role, like SOC Analyst or Penetration Tester (be weary of this one, it's extremely difficult with no experience).

**Core Certifications**
- CompTIA
  - A+
  - Network+
  - Security+

**Specialized Certifications**
- SOC Analyst
  - Splunk Core User and/or Power User
  - Blue Team Level 1
- Cloud Security
  - AWS Solutions Architect Associate
  - AWS Security Specialty
  - Azure has a lot of potential certifications for security specialists - see [here](https://learn.microsoft.com/en-us/certifications/roles/security-engineer){:target="_blank"} for a collection of them
